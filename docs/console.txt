The console module acts as a BaseSequentialStream at a user defined area of the LCD.

Requirements:
The console code requires a lld that has vertical scroll implemented.
It is also necessary to enable the scroll code:

	#define GDISP_NEED_SCROLL TRUE

Usage:

	#include "console.h"
	
	/* Define a console object */
	GLCDConsole CON1;
	
	/* initialise the console to take up the entire screen */
	lcdConsoleInit(&CON1, 0, 0, 320, 240, &fontLarger, Black, White);
	
	/* print something */
	chprintf((BaseSequentialStream *)&CON1, "Hello the time is %d\nGoodbye.", chTimeNow());
