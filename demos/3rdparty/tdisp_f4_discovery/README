Discription
===========
This is a demo project for testing the TDISP/HD44780
on a STM32F4-Discovery board.

The first line of the display will show: ChibiOS/GFX
The second line wil show: TDISP/HD44780 with a custom charactor in front.

If the connected display is a 4 line display:
The third line will stay empty
The forth line will show the cursor modes.

Display type
============
The demo is written for a 4 lines display. If have a display with less lines, change the TDISP_COLUMNS setting
gfxconf.h in the project directory to the count of your display.
The software will react upon this setting.

Hardware connection
===================
The datalines D4 to D7 of the HD44780 compatible display must be connected to the PE0 to PE3 output pins
of the Discovery board. The RS-line of the display must be connected to PD0 of the Discovery board 
and the CS-line of the display must be connected to PD1 of the Discovery board.
The R/W-line of the display must be connected to ground, because reading from the display is not used.

The project directory contains a custom STM32F4 Discovery board file. If you want to change the connection to
the Discovery board, change the custom board file accordingly.

Building
========
You have to check the provided Makefile to meet your installation of the ARM-GCC Toolchain.
