This is the same as the Olimex-SAM7EX256-GE8 board except that it uses the GE12 display controller
instead of the GE8 display controller.

See the Olimex-SAM7EX256-GE8 board file directory for example Makefiles etc.
Don't forget to change the example Makefile to point the GFX board file to the GE12 instead of the GE8.
